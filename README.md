## Automatic Hugo Site Deployment
This repository is set up with a GitHub Actions workflow that automatically builds and deploys the Hugo website to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

### Features:
  * Continuous Deployment: Any commits to the main branch will trigger the deployment workflow, ensuring that the live website is always up-to-date with the latest changes.
  * Hugo Environment Setup: The workflow automatically sets up the required Hugo environment, including installing the specified version of Hugo (currently 0.123.4) and enabling the extended version with additional features like SCSS/SASS support.
  * Content Compilation: The Hugo static files are compiled with draft content included (-D flag), unused cached resources removed (--gc flag), and the generated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files minified (--minify flag) for better performance.
  * GitHub Pages Deployment: After compilation, the built website is automatically published to the gh-pages branch, which is used by GitHub Pages to serve the live website.
  * Submodules and Git History: The workflow fetches Git submodules (e.g., Hugo themes) and the entire commit history, ensuring that the .GitInfo and .Lastmod values are correctly generated by Hugo.
  * Custom Domain Support (Optional): If you want to use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site, you can uncomment the cname input in the workflow file and set it to your desired domain.


With this automated deployment setup, you can focus on writing and developing your Hugo website, while the workflow takes care of building and publishing the latest version to GitHub Pages whenever changes are made to the main branch.
